            Imagine you and your partner are playing a piece of music together. You can hear what they play, but you can't hear your own notes. How would you keep in sync? How would you know if the music was good?

        <p class="content">
            That's what it's like for a couple new to being physical with each other. It takes time, communication, patience, and a lot of love to learn each other.

            kamagapē makes this process easier by using music as a metaphor. Each act of physical intimacy is done in time, with a given tempo and dynamic. And afterwards, kamagapē makes it easy to communicate about what happened, and to iteratively improve. So the two of you can make the best music together.
