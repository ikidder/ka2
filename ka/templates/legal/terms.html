            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p>From everyone at kamagape.com, thank you for using our site! Because we don't know every one of our users personally, we have to put in place some Terms of Service to help keep the ship afloat.</p>
            <p>When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are referring to kamagape.com. When we say “Services”, we mean any product created and maintained by kamagape.com. When we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people that create an account with one or more of our Services.</p>
            <p>We may update these Terms of Service in the future. When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms of Service. That's true for any of our existing and future products and all features that we add to our Services over time. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving that right or provision. These terms do contain a limitation of our liability.</p>
            <p>If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account. That's a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by being open about who we are, how we work, and keeping an open door to <a href="mailto:m_and_i@kamagape.com">your feedback</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p content">
